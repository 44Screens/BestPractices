## Introduction

Issues are a great way to track down a particular topic in the project. To do so, issues needs a bit of love to stay well organized and clear for everyone.

If you have any question or if something is not clear enough, you can create an issue in this repository.

## Bug reporting

Part of the use of issues is bug reporting. When creating a bug report, it's best to keep things short, but clear.

### Issue title

It's best to reference what you're talking about right in the title. For instance, if you bug occurs in the puzzle game, you should begin the issue like this :

>Puzzle Game:

The rest of the title is a brief description of the bug itself :

>Puzzle Game: images are not scaled properly

### Issue description

Here is the important part. In order to provide the best clues about what's going on, you need to provide a instructions to reproduce the bug. A simple list of the steps that lead to this bug is perfect. To keep with our puzzle game example, your issue description should look like this :

>- Open the puzzle game
>- Drag and drop any piece from the stack to the grid
>- The image do not fill the grid

An image is worth a thousand words right? So feel free to add screenshots!
Simply drag and drop your images from your local hard drive into the issue description, it will upload it.

To wrap it up, feel free to share any information, even if you're not sure about it. Making assumptions about a bug and it's cause can lead to further reflexions, so don't be shy child!

### Assignees

A great way to let people know that they need to do something in relation with your issue is to assign them. Just click on the dropdown menu in the right panel and select the people you want to get notified. 

### Labels

Labels are a great way to filter the issues. You can assign any label you want to an issue. In our case, the label 'bug' is perfect, but you can add more like 'could not reproduce', if you have difficulties to reproduce the bug.

If you can't find a label that suits your issue, feel free to create one!

### Example
